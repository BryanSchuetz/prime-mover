We make great stuff, for ourselves and for others. **We handcraft focused, adaptive sites for clients**. We believe in a rapid, iterative process that solves the right problems at the right time.

**We believe in open source**—so we contribute regularly to the ever-growing ecosystem of great software that's currently transforming the web.

**We like to help**—so we offer deeply discounted services to socially responsible businesses and nonprofits.

**We like to talk**—so if you have any questions, want to run something by us, or just want to find the best places in the city for a good pour-over, [get in touch](/contact).

<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<div class="work-block">
<p>It's true, we're small—but we're wiry, and focused. We only take on a few clients at a time and we go full tilt for them. While we believe in the fundamental principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a>, we're not devout about it. <strong>An open, honest, and frequent dialogue about a project's progress, objectives, and roadblocks is the most essential component to building great stuff</strong>—this, we believe.</p>

<p>Everything starts with an initial free consult. Let us know what you're working on—we'll think through it together and see if we can help out. If it's not right for us, we'll help you figure out what your next steps might be. <strong>We like to help</strong>.</p></div>
