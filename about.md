title: About Us
---
We make great stuff, for ourselves and for others. **We handcraft focused, adaptive sites for clients**. We believe in a rapid, iterative process that solves the right problems at the right time.

**We believe in open source**—so we contribute regularly to the ever-growing ecosystem of great software that's currently transforming the web.

**We like to help**—so we offer deeply discounted services to socially responsible businesses and nonprofits.

**We like to talk**—so if you have any questions, want to run something by us, or just want to find the best places in the city for a good pour-over, [get in touch](mailto:bschuetz@gmail.com).
