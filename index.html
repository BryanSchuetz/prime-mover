<h4>DAI Publications Site</h4>

<img src="/assets/images/screenshot_pubs.jpg" alt="">
<p>DAI is a $400m global development company leading large scale projects all over the world for clients like <a href="http://www.usaid.gov">USAID</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development">DFID</a>, and the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">EC</a>. Faced with a shrinking print budget and a mandate to reach even more readers, DAI turned to online publishing as a new channel for their content.</p>

<h4>On The Trail</h4>

<img src="/assets/images/screenshot_trail.jpg" alt="">
<p>We're into backpacking in a big way here at Tiny Quark—lightweight backpacking to be specific. So we started this little site to house a growing collection of geeky interviews with lightweight backapackers from all over the world. We ask them each a couple questions about what they take on the trail, and along the way we all learn a bit about what makes this sport so great. We've got a lot more interviews in the bag, waiting to be added—and a number of additional features we'll be rolling out soon.</p>
