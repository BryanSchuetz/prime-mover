<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<div class="work-block">
<p>It's true, we're small—but we're wiry, and focused. We only take on a few clients at a time and we go full tilt for them. While we believe in the fundamental principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a>, we're not devout about it. <strong>An open, honest, and frequent dialogue about a project's progress, objectives, and roadblocks is the most essential component to building great stuff</strong>—this, we believe.</p>
