Below are a few examples of previous work. Read the brief, have a look at the screenshot, and click through to visit the live site. Clearly, our portfolio is still growing—we'd love the chance to add some work for you to our book.

**DAI Publications Site**

DAI is a $400m global development company leading large scale projects all over the world for clients like [USAID](http://www.usaid.gov), [DFID](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development), and the [EC](http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm). Faced with a shrinking print budget and a mandate to reach even more readers, DAI turned to online publishing as a new channel for their content.

We developed new online versions of existing DAI print publications—with an adaptive design and an aggressive outreach, aimed at finding readers at their desks and on their phones.

**Blogging Templates: Middleman/Siteleaf**

The current crop of static site frameworks are fantastic—we love them. You get all the convenience of a modern web development toolchain (templating, preprocessing, minification, concatenation, etc.) with all the security, stability, and speed of shipping static files to the server.

We've built a couple blogging templates for our two favorite frameworks: [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com). Both templates are available at no cost via [Github](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz). We think the static site community is great, and maintaining these free templates is one little way we try to contribute.

**On The Trail**

We're into backpacking in a big way here at Tiny Quark—lightweight backpacking to be specific. So we started this little site to house a growing collection of geeky interviews with lightweight backapackers from all over the world.

We ask them each a couple questions about what they take on the trail, and along the way we all learn a bit about what makes this sport so great. We've got a lot more interviews in the bag, waiting to be added—and a number of additional features we'll be rolling out soon.
