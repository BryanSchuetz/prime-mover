Built as a <em>decoupled content management system</em>, and designed with responsive principles—the new site will help DAI turn their American success story into a global one.</p>

<h4>Jekyll & Siteleaf</h4>

<a class="work-image" href="https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/siteleaf-jekyll"><img src="/assets/images/screenshot_theme.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>We believe in open source—so we contribute regularly to the ever-growing ecosystem of great software that's currently transforming the web. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> themes, built for use with <a href="http://siteleaf.com">Siteleaf</a> can make all the difference for a team that includes both the tech savvy and the business minded. We make these themes, plugins, and gists freely available on <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. Let's make software better, together.</p>

<h4>On The Trail</h4>

<a class="work-image" href="http://on-the-trail.net"><img src="/assets/images/screenshot_trail.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>We're into backpacking in a big way here at Tiny Quark—lightweight backpacking to be specific. So we started this little site to house a growing collection of geeky interviews with lightweight backapackers from all over the world. We ask them each a couple questions about what they take on the trail, and along the way we all learn a bit about what makes this sport so great. We've got a lot more interviews in the bag, waiting to be added—and a number of additional features we'll be rolling out soon.</p>

<h4>DAI Publications Site</h4>

<a class="work-image" href="http://dai-global-developments.com/developments/summer-2015/"><img src="/assets/images/screenshot_pubs.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>DAI is a $400m global development company leading large scale projects all over the world for clients like <a href="http://www.usaid.gov">USAID</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development">DFID</a>, and the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">EC</a>. Faced with a shrinking print budget and a mandate to reach even more readers, DAI turned to online publishing as a new channel for their content.</p>

<h4>Preparedness and Response</h4>

<a class="work-image" href="http://preparednessandresponse.org"><img src="/assets/images/pandr.jpg" alt=""></a>
<p>The Preparedness and Response project (P&R) is one component of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats program. The EPT initiative detects and responds to viruses such as Ebola, avian influenza, and MERS that move between animal and human populations. A decoupled CMS, publishing highly cacheable static assets, ready for hosting on a CDN anywhere around the world—allowed P&R to quickly establish an online presence with enough flexibility to grow as the project scaled up its activities.</p>
